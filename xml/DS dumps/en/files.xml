    <Text>\n\n\n          BOTANY BOOK\n~About Medicinal Herbs~</Text>
    <Text>\nAs you may know, there are\nmany plants that have medicinal \nqualities. Since ancient times,\nhumans have been healing\nwounds and diseases using\nvarious plants.</Text>
    <Text>\nIn this book, we're going to\nexplore three such herbs that\ngrow around the Arklay\nmountains and provide\ninformation on those plants\nwith medical properties.</Text>
    <Text>Each herb has a different color\nand a different effect as a\nmedical plant: the green one\nrecovers physical strength, the\nblue one neutralizes natural\ntoxins, while the red herb does\nnot have any effect by itself.</Text>
    <Text>The red herb is only effective\nwhen it is mixed with other\nherbs.\nFor example, if you mix this\nherb with the herb that\nrecovers physical strength, the\nrecovery effect will be tripled.</Text>
    <Text>By adjusting the amount and\nexperimenting with these three\nherbs, you can create various\nkinds of medicines but I'll\nleave the details in your hands,\nbecause that's the best way\nto acquire true knowledge.</Text>

    <Text>May 9, 1998 \n\nAt night, I played poker with\nScott the guard, Alias and Steve\nthe researcher.\nSteve was really lucky, but I\nthink he was cheating.\nWhat a scumbag!</Text>
    <Text>May 10, 1998\n\nToday, a high ranking\nresearcher asked me to take\ncare of a new kind of monster.\nThey look like gorillas without\nany skin.</Text>
    <Text>\nThey told me to feed them live\nfood. When I threw in a pig,\nthey were playing with it...\ntearing off the pig's legs and\npulling out the guts before\nthey actually ate it.</Text>
    <Text>May 11, 1998\n\nAround 5 o'clock this morning,\nScott came in and woke me up\nsuddenly. He was wearing a\nprotection suit that looked like\na space suit. He told me to put\none on as well.</Text>
    <Text>\n\nI heard there was an accident\nin the basement lab. It's no\nwonder, those researchers\nnever rest, even at night.</Text>
    <Text>May 12, 1998\n\nI've been wearing this\nannoying space suit since\nyesterday, I feel all musty and\nmy skin is very itchy. By way\nof revenge, I didn't feed those\ndogs today. Now I feel better.</Text>
    <Text>\nMay 13, 1998\n\nI went to the medical room\nbecause my back is all swollen\nand itchy.</Text>
    <Text>\nThey put a big bandage on my\nback and the doctor told me I\ndid not need to wear the space\nsuit anymore.\n\nI guess I can sleep well tonight.</Text>
    <Text>May 14, 1998\n\nWhen I woke up this morning, I \nfound another blister on my\nfoot. It was annoying and I\nended up dragging my foot as I\nwent to the dogs' pen.</Text>
    <Text>\nThey have been quiet since\nmorning, which was very\nunusual. I found that some of\nthem had escaped.\nI'll be in real trouble if the\nhigher-ups find out.</Text>
    <Text>May 15, 1998\n\nEven though I didn't feel well, \nI decided to go to see Nancy. \nIt's my first day off in a long \ntime. But I was stopped by the \nguard on the way out.</Text>
    <Text>\nThey say the company has\nordered that no one leaves the\ngrounds. I can't even make a\nphone call.\nWhat kind of sick joke is this?!</Text>
    <Text>May 16, 1998\n\nI heard a researcher who tried\nto escape from this mansion\nwas shot last night.\nMy entire body feels burning\nhot and itchy at night.</Text>
    <Text>\nWhen I was scratching the\nswelling on my arm, a lump of\nrotten flesh dropped off.\nWhat the hell is happening to\nme?</Text>
    <Text>May 19, 1998\n\nFever gone but itchy.\nHungry and eat doggie food. \nItchy itchy Scott came.\nUgly face so killed him.\nTasty.</Text>

    <Text>\nAlma, be calm and read this.\n\nI think I've told you that I\nmoved to a pharmaceutical \ncompany's lab. They\nheadhunted me.</Text>
    <Text>Last month, there was an\naccident in the lab and a virus\nwe were studying escaped.\nAll my colleagues who were\ninfected by the virus are dead.\nWell, to be more accurate,\nthey've become the living\ndead.</Text>
    <Text>They still wander around.\nSome of them are knocking\non my room door desperately\nright now.\n\nBut there's no sign of\nintelligence behind their eyes.</Text>

    <Text>\n\n\nPLANT 42 REPORT</Text>
    <Text>4 days have passed since the\naccident and the plant at Point\n42 is growing amazingly fast.\nIt has been effected by the\nT-Virus differently than other\nplants have been and shows\nunique shape in addition to its\nsize.</Text>
    <Text>Looking at the way it behaves,\nit is now difficult to determine\nwhat kind of plant it was\noriginally.\n\nThere are two ways in which\nPlant 42 gathers nutrition. </Text>
    <Text>The first one is through its\nroots that reach into the\nbasement.\nImmediately after the accident,\na scientist went mad and broke\nthe water tank in the basement.\nNow the basement is filled with\nwater.</Text>
    <Text>\nIt is easily imaginable that some\nchemical elements were blended\nin the water which presumably\npromoted the incredibly fast\ngrowth of Plant 42.</Text>
    <Text>\n\nAnother part of Plant 42 has\ngrown through the air ducts and\nis now hanging from the ceiling\nof the first floor.</Text>
    <Text>\nThis part of Plant 42 contains\nvarious vines and bulb-like\nstructures, which it uses for\nits second method of\ngathering nutrition.</Text>
    <Text>Upon sensing movement, Plant\n42 shoots its vines around its\nprey and restrains it.\n\nIt then begins leeching the\nvictim's blood, by using the\nsuckers located on the back of\nits vines.</Text>
    <Text>It also appears to have some\nintelligence.\n\nIt has been witnessed using its\nvines to block doorways when\nit has either captured prey or\nis in a state of rest.</Text>
    <Text>\nSeveral staff members have\nalready fallen victim to this.\n\n                               May 21, 1998\n                               Henry Sarton</Text>

    <Text>To: \nGeneral Manager, \nSanitation Division\n\nFrom: \nSpecial Committee on Disasters\nRaccoon Special Research Dept.</Text>
    <Text>\n\nThis memorandum is strictly\nconfidential and must be\ndestroyed as soon as it is\nunderstood.</Text>
    <Text>\n\nRegarding the "T-Virus"\noutbreak which occurred \nrecently, the Committee \nconducted a field survey.</Text>
    <Text>\nAccording to the survey results,\nestimates on the amount of\ndamage caused by the accident\nare considerably greater than\nreported earlier.</Text>
    <Text>\nFirst, although it is very\ndifficult to obtain accurate data\nin terms of actual numbers, it is\nthought that more than half of\nthe researchers died after\nexposure to the "T-Virus".</Text>
    <Text>\n\nThe body count will most likely\nincrease since nearly all of the\nsurvivors show symptoms\nassociated with the "T-Virus".</Text>
    <Text>\nSecond, our security system\nis still in operation.\n\nHowever, our special security\nguard squad has been nearly\nwiped out.</Text>
    <Text>Because of that, research\ninformation considered by our\ncompany to be top secret has\nbeen leaked to outsiders.\n\nCounter-measures should be\ntaken as soon as possible.</Text>
    <Text>Lastly, many of the "subjects"\nfrom the experiment have\nescaped and are out of control.\n\nWe believe that some\nresearchers were killed by\nthese "subjects" and their\nbodies were mutilated.</Text>
    <Text>By curious coincidence, these\nevents are proof of the success\nof our research.\n\nHowever, there is also a very\nhigh risk that this news may be\nleaked to the press if we don't\nact immediately.</Text>
    <Text>\nThe condition is very serious.\n\nOur operation to cover-up the\nsituation is difficult to attain, \nhowever we hope the problem\nwill be solved quickly.</Text>
    <Text>We are especially concerned\nthat the State Police and\nＳＴＡＲＳ are intervening too\nquickly.\n\nWe need to act on this situation\nas well.</Text>

    <Text>\nMay 20th. Around 10pm, a\n20-year-old young woman's\nbody was found by a passer-by\non the left bank of Marble River\nin the Cider District of Raccoon\nCity.</Text>
    <Text>\nRaccoon police assume it to be\na grizzly or other animal's\ndoing due to teeth marks along\nthe woman's arms and a severed\nleft foot which suggests\nconsiderable power. </Text>
    <Text>\nPolice speculate that the woman\nwas hiking in the Arklay\nmountains when the attack\noccurred. Police have no leads\non the identity of the woman\nat this time.</Text>
    <Text>RACCOON WEEKLY June 16, 1998\n\nMONSTERS IN THE ARKLAY\nMOUNTAINS?\n\nSome people claim they've seen\nmonsters in the Arklay\nmountains.</Text>
    <Text>These "monsters" are\nallegedly about the same size as\nlarge dogs and usually run in\npacks as wolves do.\nIt may sound like a group of\nwild dogs, but these "monsters"\nare supposedly very fierce and\nvery resistant to attacks.</Text>
    <Text>It is said that they won't bother\npeople unless they are\nprovoked, so it may be\nadvisable to remain out of the\nArklay Mountains for the time\nbeing until this issue has been\ncleared up.</Text>

    <Text>As I stated in the last report,\nthere are some common features\nfound in the cells of the plant\ninfected by the Tyrant virus.\n\nWe have also found another\ninteresting fact through some\nexperiments.</Text>
    <Text>\nWe found an element that\ndestroys these plant cells\nrapidly in "UMB No. 16", one\nof the series of UMB chemicals\nthat we used for that\nexperiment.</Text>
    <Text>We named this "UMB No. 16"\n"V-JOLT".\n\nAccording to our calculations,\nit will take less than 5 seconds\nto destroy Plant 42 if we put\nthe "V-JOLT" directly on its\nroots.</Text>
    <Text>You need to mix some of the\nUMB series chemicals in a\nspecific order to create\n"V-JOLT". But the UMB series\nchemicals may generate a\npoisonous gas which is harmful\nto the human body.</Text>
    <Text>\nExtreme caution should be taken\nwhen handling these chemicals.\n\nFollowing are the types of UMB\nseries chemicals and their brief\ncharacteristics.</Text>
